A 20-day-long course aimed at those who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in the industry - junior Linux sysadmin, DevOps-related work, and similar. Server focussed and command line, but assumes essentially no prior knowledge, and starts off very gently - designed to be well-suited to a Windows or Apple person as well as those that already using Linux in some form. This was a paid course in the past, but is now free and fully open source.

1. Learn Linux enough to admin your own server
2. The focus is on practical skills
3. Heavily hands-on
4. Acquire skills during a month, commiting of 1-2 hours each day
5. Lots of curated external links
6. Much less ‘formal’ than RHEL or Linux Foundation training
